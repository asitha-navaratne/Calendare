# Calendare

<p align="justify">A little project I started working on during my spare time. Excuse the awful name.</p>

<p align="justify">Calendare is a simple static calendar page that allows a user to store events on the browser's local storage. The day tiles and dates are generated using JavaScript. A user can click on a date and enter an event on the modal window that appears. The stored events will persist even after the browser window has been closed.</p>

<p align="justify">As of now there are some issues with generating the website on some mobile browsers, particularly those with a width less than 470 pixels. I plan to make this site fully responsive in the future.</p>
