# Calendare

<p align="justify">A little project I started working on during my spare time. Excuse the awful name.</p>

<p align="justify">Calendare is a simple static calendar page that allows a user to store events on the browser's local storage. The day tiles and dates are generated using JavaScript. A user can click on a date and enter an event on the modal window that appears. The events are stored on local storage and will persist even after the browser window has been closed.</p>

<p align="justify">I added some media queries to make the page responsive for mobile browsers. The event modal looks a bit bland though, and might need a redesign in the future. There was an issue in mobile browsers where the height of the URL bar interferes with the height of the website body, which causes the website to scroll vertically and the background image to jump about when the URL bar disappears. This was solved by setting the heights of the html, body and container elements to 100% instead of 100vh.</p>
