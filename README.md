# Calendare

<p align="justify">A little project I started working on during my spare time. Excuse the awful name.</p>

<p align="justify">Calendare is a simple static calendar page that allows a user to store events on the browser's local storage. The day tiles and dates are generated using JavaScript. A user can click on a date and enter an event on the modal window that appears. The events are stored on local storage and will persist even after the browser window has been closed.</p>

<p align="justify">I added some media queries to make the page responsive for mobile browsers. The event modal looks a bit bland though, and might need a redesign in the future. I noticed that on some mobile devices the background image would shift vertically, though this issue does not appear when testing on the browser. I tried to fix this issue but might need to do further testing on other physical devices as well.</p>
