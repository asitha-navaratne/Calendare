# Calendare

<p align="justify">A little project I started working on during my spare time. Excuse the awful name.</p>

<p align="justify">Calendare is a simple static calendar page that allows a user to store events on the browser's local storage. The day tiles and dates are generated by 
JavaScript. A user can click on a day and enter an event on the modal window that appears. The data will persist even after the browser window has been closed.</p>

<p align="justify">Pay the site a visit at https://calendare.netlify.app/</p>
